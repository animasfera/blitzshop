# Terms of Service

Thank you for using Leela.Game!

Leela.Game services are provided by Leela Game B.V., and the events, materials, online courses and other products, information about which can be found on the "Events" page, are hosted and provided by other companies represented by the Event Organizers. These Terms of Service govern the use of the website, web pages, applications, and other products and services of Leela.Game.
Accepting These Term
What's What. Leela.Game's products, features and offerings collectively referred to as "Leela.Game Properties" or our "Services". These Terms apply to any Site(s) on which they are posted; where other terms or agreements are instead posted, those terms or agreements apply to the extent they conflict with these Terms. The material, including without limitation information, data, text, editorial content, design elements, look and feel, formatting, graphics, images, photographs, videos, music, sounds and other content contained in or delivered via the Services or otherwise made available by Leela.Game in connection with the Services is the "Site Content" (or "Content"). Any material (including the foregoing categories) that you contribute, provide, post or make available using the Services is "Your Content.
Who's Who. When these Terms use the term "Organiser," we mean event creators using the Services to create events displayed on the Site for consumers using our Services (a) to consume information about or attend Events ("Consumers"), or (b) for any other reason. Organisers, Consumers and third parties using our Services are all referred to in these Terms collectively as "Users," "you" or "your."
If you are an Organiser offering events with paid tickets, Leela.Game's Agency Agreement are also applicable to you. These Terms of Service are applicable to you if you are an Organiser offering events with paid tickets; if you are a Consumer; if you are a third party interacting with our Services not as an Organiser or a Consumer. And, by agreeing to these Terms of Service, you acknowledge you have read the Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement applicable to all Users. We may sometimes provide you with services that are not described in these Terms of Service: unless we have entered into a separate, signed agreement that expressly supersedes these Terms of Service, these Terms of Service will apply to those services as well.
What the "Terms of Service" Means. These Terms of Service comprise Leela.Game's "Terms." These Terms are a legally binding agreement between you and Leela.Game governing your access to and use of the Services and setting out your rights and responsibilities when you use the Services. By using any of our Services (including browsing a Site), you are agreeing to these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use or access the Services. If you will be using the Services on behalf of an entity (such as on behalf of your employer), you agree to these Terms on behalf of that entity and its affiliates and you represent that you have the authority to do so. In such case, "you" and "your" will refer to that entity as well as yourself.
Leela.Game's Services and Role
What We Do. Leela.Game's Services provide a simple and quick means for Organisers to create speaker profiles, organiser profiles, and other web pages related to their events, promote those pages and events to visitors or browsers on the Services or elsewhere online, manage online or onsite ticketing and registration, solicit donations. Descriptions of other and more specific services can generally be found on the Site Leela.Game.
How We Fit In. Leela.Game is not the creator, organiser or owner of the events listed on the Services. Rather, Leela.Game provides its Services, which allow Organisers to manage ticketing and registration and promote their events. The Organiser is solely responsible for ensuring that any page displaying an event on the Services (and the event itself) meet all applicable local, state, provincial, national and other laws, rules and regulations, and that the goods and services described on the event page are delivered as described and in an accurate satisfactory manner. The Organiser of a paid event selects the payment processing method for its event as more fully described in the Agency Agreement. Consumers must use whatever payment processing method the Organiser selects. If the Organiser selects a payment processing method that uses a third party to process the payment, then neither Leela.Game nor any of its payment processing partners processes the transaction but we transmit the Consumer's payment details to the Organiser's designated payment provider. If an Organiser uses Leela.Game Payment Processing Leela.Game also acts as the Organiser's limited agent solely for the purpose of using our third party payment service providers to collect payments made by Consumers on the Services and passing such payments to the Organiser.
Privacy and Consumer Information
We know your personal information is important to you and it is important to Leela.Game, too. Information provided to Leela.Game by Users or collected by Leela.Game is governed by our Privacy Policy.
If you are an Organiser, you represent, warrant and agree that (a) you will at all times comply with all applicable local, state, provincial, national and other laws, rules and regulations with respect to information you collect from (or receive about) consumers, and (b) you will at all times comply with any applicable policies posted on the Site with respect to information you collect from (or receive about) consumers.
Term; Termination
These Terms apply to you as soon as you access the Services by any means and continue in effect until they are terminated. There may come a time where either you or Leela.Game decides it's best to part ways as described in Sections 4.2 or 4.3 below. When that happens, these Terms will generally no longer apply. However, as described in Section 4.4, certain provisions will always remain applicable to both you and Leela.Game.
Leela.Game may terminate your right to use the Services at any time

1. if you violate or breach these Terms;
2. if you misuse or abuse the Services, or use the Services in a way not intended or permitted by Leela.Game; or
3. if allowing you to access and use the Services would violate any applicable local, state, provincial, national and other laws, rules and regulations or would expose Leela.Game to legal liability.

Leela.Game may choose to stop offering the Services, or any particular portion of the Service, or modify or replace any aspect of the Service, at any time. We will use reasonable efforts to provide you with notice of our termination of your access to the Services, where, in Leela.Game's sole discretion, failure to do so would materially prejudice you. You agree that Leela.Game will not be liable to you or any third-party as a result of its termination of your right to use or otherwise access the Services.
Except to the extent you have agreed otherwise in a separate written agreement between you and Leela.Game, you may terminate your access to the Services and the general applicability of Terms by deleting your account. If you are a Consumer using the Services without a registered account, your only option for these Terms to no longer apply is to stop accessing the Services indefinitely. So long as you continue to access the Services, even without an account, these Terms remain in effect. If there is a separate agreement between you and Leela.Game governing your use of the Services and that agreement terminates or expires, these Terms (as unmodified by such agreement) will govern your use of the Services after such termination or expiration.
All provisions of these Terms that by their nature should survive termination of these Terms will survive (including, without limitation, all limitations on liability, releases, indemnification obligations, disclaimers of warranties, agreements to arbitrate, choices of law and judicial forum and intellectual property protections and licences).
Release and Indemnification
This is where you agree to cover Leela.Game if you use the Service in a way that causes Leela.Game to be the subject of a legal matter, or to face other claims or expenses, or as otherwise set forth herein, to the extent permitted by applicable laws.
Release. You hereby agree to release Leela.Game from all damages (whether direct, indirect, incidental, consequential or otherwise), losses, liabilities, costs and expenses of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of a dispute between you and a third party (including other Users) in connection with the Services or any event listed on the Services.
Indemnification. You agree to defend, indemnify and hold Leela.Game and each of its and their respective officers, directors, agents, co-branders, licensors, payment processing partners, other partners and employees, harmless from any and all damage (whether direct, indirect, incidental, consequential or otherwise), loss, liability, cost and expense (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' and accounting fees) resulting from any claim, demand, suit, proceeding (whether before an arbitrator, court, mediator or otherwise) or investigation made by any third party (each a "Claim") relating to or arising out of:
your breach of these Terms (including any terms or agreements or policies incorporated into these Terms);
your use of the Services in violation of these Terms or other policies we post or make available;
your breach of any applicable local, state, provincial, national or other law, rule or regulation or the rights of any third party;
Leela.Gameâ€™s collection and remission of taxes; and
if you are an Organiser, your events (including where Leela.Game has provided Services with respect to those events), provided that this indemnification will not apply to the extent that the Claim arises out of Leela.Game's gross negligence or willful misconduct.

Leela.Game will provide notice to you of any such Claim, provided that the failure or delay by Leela.Game in providing such notice will not limit your obligations hereunder except to the extent you are materially prejudiced by such failure. Also, in certain circumstances, Leela.Game may choose to handle the Claim ourselves, in which case you agree to cooperate with Leela.Game in any way we request.
Disclaimer of Warranties and Assumption of Risks by You
We strive to provide Services in the way you need them, but there are some things it is important for you to understand that we cannot promise.

To the extent permitted by applicable laws, the Services are provided on a "as is" and "as available" basis. Leela.Game expressly disclaims all warranties of any kind, express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of Agencyability, title, non-infringement and fitness for a particular purpose. For example, Leela.Game makes no warranty that:
the Services (or any portion of the Services) will meet your requirements or expectations;
the Services will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free; or
the results that may be obtained from the use of the Services will be accurate or reliable.

You acknowledge that Leela.Game has no control over and does not guarantee the quality, safety, accuracy or legality of any event or Content associated with an event, the truth or accuracy of any information provided by Users (including the Consumer's personal information shared with Organisers in connection with events) or the ability of any User to perform or actually complete a transaction. Leela.Game has no responsibility to you for, and hereby disclaims all liability arising from, the acts or omissions of any third parties that Leela.Game requires to provide the Services, that an Organiser chooses to assist with an event, or that you choose to contract with when using the Services.

You understand and agree that some events may carry inherent risk, and by participating in those events, you choose to assume those risks voluntarily. For example, some events may carry risk of illness, bodily injury or disability and you freely and willfully assume those risks by choosing to participate in those events.

The foregoing disclaimers apply to the maximum extent permitted by law. You may have other statutory rights. However, the duration of statutorily required warranties, if any, will be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.
Limitation of Liability
To the extent permitted by applicable laws, or as otherwise set forth herein, Leela.Game and any person or entity associated with Leela.Game's provision of the Services (e.g., an affiliate, vendor, strategic partner or employee) ("Associated Parties"), will not be liable to you or any third party, for:

any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages, including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, opportunity costs, intangible losses, or the cost of substitute services (even if Leela.Game has been advised of the possibility of such damages); or
Your Content. In addition, other than the obligation of Leela.Game to pay out Event Registration Fees in certain circumstances to certain organisers under the Agency Agreement, and only in accordance with the terms therein, the maximum aggregate liability of Leela.Game or Associated Parties is limited to the following:
for Organisers of events with paid tickets, and subject to the terms of the Agency Agreement, the fees (net of Leela.Game Payment Processing Fees) that you paid us in the three (3) month period immediately preceding the circumstances giving rise to your claim; and
for Organisers of events with free tickets only, Consumers or other Users, (1) the total amount of all tickets or registrations that you purchased or made through the Services in the three (3) month period immediately preceding the circumstances giving rise to your claim; or (2) if you made no such purchases, one hundred SGD (SGD 100). .

Nothing in these Terms is intended to exclude or limit any condition, warranty, right or liability which may not be lawfully excluded or limited. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or conditions or the limitation or exclusion of liability for loss or damage caused by willful acts, negligence, breach of contract or breach of implied terms, or incidental or consequential damages. Accordingly, only those liability and other limitations which are lawful in your jurisdiction (if any) will apply to you and our liability is limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.

Licences and Permits Organisers Must Obtain
If you are an Organiser, without limiting the generality of any representations or warranties provided elsewhere in these Terms of Service, you represent and warrant to us that:

(a) You and your affiliates will obtain, prior to the start of ticket sales, all applicable licences, permits, and authorizations (individually and collectively, "Licensure") with respect to events hosted by you or your affiliates on the Services. Licensure includes but is not limited to property operation permits and fire marshal permits;

(b) You and your affiliates will comply, and will ensure that the venues for each event hosted by you or your affiliates on the Services will comply, with all applicable laws, regulations, rules and ordinances;

(c) You will only request that Leela.Game offer tickets to an event after you have obtained any specific Licensures for such event, including, but not limited to, any state, county, municipal or other local authority's authorization of the event, traffic engineering authorizations, fire department inspection reports, authorization to receive minors (if applicable), sanitary authorization (if applicable), and any other potential applicable authorization; and (d) you and your affiliates will maintain in force throughout the term of access to the Service the applicable Licensure for organiser to promote, produce, sponsor host and sell tickets for all events hosted by you or your affiliates on the Services;

(d) Without limiting the generality of any release provided under these Terms of Service, as a material inducement to Leela.Game permitting you to access and use the Services, you hereby agree to release Leela.Game, and its affiliates and subsidiaries, and each of its and their respective parent companies, subsidiaries, officers, affiliates, representatives, shareholders, contractors, directors, agents, partners and employees from all damages (whether direct, indirect, incidental, consequential or otherwise), losses, liabilities, costs and expenses of every kind and nature, including, without limitation, attorneys' fees, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with your or your affiliates' Licensure, any failure to obtain or maintain any Licensure, or any error in obtaining or maintaining any Licensure;

(e) Without limiting your indemnification obligations elsewhere under these Terms of Service, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold Leela.Game, and its affiliates and subsidiaries, and each of its and their respective officers, directors, agents, co-branders, licensors, payment processing partners, other partners and employees, harmless from any and all damage (whether direct, indirect, incidental, consequential or otherwise), loss, liability, cost and expense (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' and accounting fees) resulting from any Claim due to or arising out of your or your affiliates' Licensure, any failure to obtain or maintain any Licensure, or any error in obtaining or maintaining any Licensure. You agree to provide evidence of Licensure and related information prior to offering tickets or registrations for events on the Site and promptly upon the reasonable request of Leela.Game from time to time.
Scraping or Commercial Use of Site Content is Prohibited
The Site Content is not intended for your commercial use. You have no right to use, and agree not to use, any Site Content for your own commercial purposes. You have no right to, and agree not to scrape, crawl, or employ any automated means to extract data from the Site(s).
Fees and Refunds.
Fees That We Charge. Creating an account, listing an event and accessing the Services are free. However, we charge fees when you sell or buy paid tickets. These fees may vary based on individual agreements between Leela.Game and certain Organisers. Organisers ultimately determine whether these fees will be passed along to Consumers and shown as "Fees" on the applicable event page or absorbed into the ticket or registration price and paid by the Organiser out of ticket and registration gross proceeds. The fees charged to Organisers may include certain other charges, including without limitation, facility fees, royalties, taxes, processing fees and fulfilment fees. Therefore, the fees paid by Consumers for an event are not necessarily the same as those charged by Leela.Game to the applicable Organiser or the standard fees described on the Services to Organisers. In addition, certain fees are meant, on average, to defray certain costs incurred by Leela.Game, but may in some cases include an element of profit and in some cases include an element of loss. Leela.Game does not control (and thus cannot disclose) fees levied by your bank and/or credit card company, including fees for purchasing tickets and registrations in foreign currencies or from foreign persons. Be sure to check with your bank or credit card company prior to engaging in a transaction to understand all applicable fees, credit card surcharges and currency conversion rates.
Ticket Transfers. If you wish to transfer tickets to an event you have purchased on Leela.Game, in some instances Leela.Game may be able to accommodate this for you. In all other instances, please contact the Organiser of the event to arrange for ticket transfer. If you are unable to reach the Organiser, or the Organiser is unable to arrange a ticket transfer, please contact us.
Refunds. Because all transactions are between an Organiser and its respective attendees, Leela.Game asks that all Consumers contact the applicable Organiser of their event with any refund requests. You can find help with getting a refund here.

(a) If you are a Consumer, you acknowledge that should you receive a refund for your ticket, you will discard any ticket that we or any Organiser has delivered, and will not use it (or any copy of it) to attend the event. Violation of the foregoing constitutes fraud. You acknowledge that the applicable procedure to check the validity of the ticket must always be followed. Leela.Game will not be held liable under any circumstances for any costs arisen from non-compliance by Organisers with applicable procedures that must be implemented by Organisers to check validity of tickets. Leela.Game will not be held liable under any circumstances for costs and/or damage associated with tickets arisen from situations with fraud and/or for damage associated with the purchase of the ticket through non-official means, such as third parties.

(b) If you are an Organiser, you acknowledge that the applicable procedure to check the validity of the ticket must always be followed. Leela.Game will not be held liable under any circumstances for any costs arisen from non-compliance by Organisers with applicable procedures that must be implemented by Organisers to check validity of tickets. Leela.Game will not be held liable under any circumstances for costs and/or damage associated with tickets arisen from situations with fraud and/or for damage associated with the purchase of the ticket through non-official means, such as third parties.
